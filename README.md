## Parts of the user flow:

* Open full/half screen bucket list

## User Stories:
* As a user, I want to be able to find a place or event to visit so that I can make reservations or attend.
* As a user, I should be able to narrow my search so I can decide on a specific experience, date range, and location
* As a user, I should be able to see what is available in my local area so that I can plan transportation better.
* As a user, I should be aware of the weather so I can dress for the occasion at the place or event.
* As a user, I should be able to add what I've planned in my planner/todo list so that I can see where I'm going to go, where I've been, where I desire to go and when they occur.
* As a user, I should be able to edit and delete what I added in my planner/todo list so that I can keep my list relevant.
* As a user, I should be able to get a summary of the event or place so that I can make a better decision if the event or place is of interest and is achievable.
* As a user, I should be able to go to the homepage on either Eventbrite or Foursquare for the particular selection so that I can get more details.
* As a user, I should be able to tab and select events or places with a keyboard so that I feel the website is accessible to me.
